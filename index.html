		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Andrew Barger, award-winning author and engineer, has extensively researched forgotten journals and magazines of the early 19th century to locate groundbreaking science fiction short stories in the English language. In doing so, he found what is possibly the first science fiction story by a female (and it is not from Mary Shelley). Andrew located the first steampunk short story, which has not been republished since 1844. There is the first voyage to the moon in a balloon, republished for the first time since 1820 that further tells of a darkness machine and a lunarian named Zuloc. Other sci-stories include the first robotic insect and an electricity gun. Once again, Andrew has searched old texts to find the very best science fiction stories from the period when the genre automated to life, some of the stories are published for the first time in nearly 200 years. Read these fantastic stories today!

				<h2> Review</h2>
				<small>By Justin Melter, Nov 17, 2013</small>
				<p>I have always been a sci-fi fan but my knowledge of early works were limited. This was a great compilation of works from the 1800's which is a really interesting view on how people then saw the possible future. I really had to laugh at some of the things they were right and wrong on. Also what I enjoyed was how they gave a little bit of a bio of each author, how they came to their beliefs, etc. Which was a really nice intro before jumping into their short stories.</p>
